To run an exercice, open CMD and run the main folder :
    python main.py

Some scripts can create other files:
- pdf : Figure used in the report
- npy : file to save a numpy array. This is used for saving data for big convergence study.

WARNING : For some convergence study, the plots given by the python script is not the same as the one in the report. This is because, to have better plots in the report, the number of simulations has been set to high number. But for computation time reason, the number of simulations has been reduced in the submission scripts.
